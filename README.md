# Hello there!

I'm Ananya, a junior at the Vellore Institute of Technology, studying Computer Science and Data Science. I'm currently learning web development 
and Machine Learning, tinkering around on Debian and falling down Neovim and tmux rabbit holes [ðŸ•³](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keD0IJP4Dtw&t=173s)!
